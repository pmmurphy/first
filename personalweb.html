								<p >Ole, my name is Sasha and I am one lucky dog or should I say, I am the cutest, most adorable puppy you will ever know. But lets start at the beginning. A beach in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. I only barely know my mom or my brothers and sisters. Suddenly my eyes opened. I was swept away by a big, cruel man. Next thing you know I was at a beach. The sun was so bright I kept my eyes shut. 
								A voice, from afar was speaking a language I have never heard before said I know longer belonged to that horrible man. Its like I stepped into a new world. I remember sitting on a very nice ladies lap. I mostly slept. I was after all still a puppy. Suddenly I was at customs, I am not fruit or drugs. I became a legal immigrant.  This is so very confusing.

							<p >But something was missing, something I longed for, but I did not know what it could be. Again, I stepped into someone’s arms, I opened my eyes, that's it, what I was missing. My new mommy I love her so much. I am Home! 
							Now I have a family, and admirers. There isn't a Motorcycle rider that doesn’t love my adorable face. From Mexico to New Jersey a cruel beginning to a wonderful family. And I rule. What I say goes. I sleep late, I awaken to a new day, everyday. Each day I just keep looking cuter and cuter. How do I do it?
							Here's how you do it. You allow nothing to happen without your express approval. It's hard work managing your peeps. You can't let it go for a second. </p>
